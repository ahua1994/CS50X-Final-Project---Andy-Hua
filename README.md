    This was by far the most difficult thing I have programmed, so far. Also probably the most enjoyable. Originally I wanted to complete this project in a week. It has now exceeded four. I started from scratch in terms of game development knowledge, and tutorials for LOVE2d online are very scarce. Shoutout to Challacade on his very helpful youtube tutorials.

    The idea for the game was inspired by 速すぎるＲＰＧ which parodies the genre of classic Japanese RPGS. There is admittedly not much gameplay in my project, but instead I chose to focus on humor. That said, I hope it still showcases the many different elements I was able to implement. I added dialogue using two methods, movement, colliders, a camera, created my own map, enemies and NPCS, death and respawn.

    I know there is a better way to code this, and a better way to organize all of my files, but this was a surefire way to stop my game from crashing. With tons of trial and error, and absurd amounts of dead-end googling, I have achieved most of what I set out to do. I now know for sure that game development is not for me. Looking at games I've played, I can only wonder how it was even possible.

    There are two dialogue systems because I could not figure out why Dialove crashes if you set events to trigger dialogue in
    love.update(). I resorted to manually printing a text box with words on top and a timer to progress through dialogue. It is not ideal but it is the only solution I could find.

    If any human is reading this, I would greatly appreciate feedback on any of my work.

    I had a lot of fun, along with moments of wanting to rip out my hair, througout CS50. I am very grateful that this course was offered for free from Harvard. Thank you to Professor Malan, and all the staff for their hard work.

    This was CS50.
